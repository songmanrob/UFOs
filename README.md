# UFOs

## Challenge

For this project, we created a website with UFO sighting information.

We used html to build the page and incorpoarated Bootstrap for consistency, professionalism, and ease of formatting.
We used CSS to make our own adjustments to formatting.
We used JavaScript make the webpage dynamic so results can be filtered by various criteria - date, city, state, country, and the shape of the sighted object.
We also used D3.js within JavaScript to make the filter enact upon the button click.

I would like to work on the formatiing even further. For example, having the text entry boxes for the filter align vertically, instead of falling immediately after the associated label, would be a nice touch.
